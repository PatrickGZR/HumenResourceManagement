Difference between MVC and Web API
1: MVC can be used to develop the web application which replies as both data and views. But Web API is used to generate the HTTP services which replies 
only as data.
2: MVC request performs tracing with the action name. On the other hand, Web API request performs tracing with the actions depending on the HTTP services.
3: MVC returns the data in the JSON format by using JSONResult. Web API returns the data in various formats, including JSON, XML and other format based on
the concept header of the request.
4: Web API includes the various features of the MVC, such as routing, model binding but these features are different and are defined in the "System.Web.Http"
assembly. And the MVC features are defined in the "System.WEb.MVC" assembly.
